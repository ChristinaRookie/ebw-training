While we're learning to use new techologies, we should make the most of two of its biggest gifts: easier collaboration and proper version-control.

## Team roles

In a traditional workflow, the most common team roles are these, and everyone works on every book:

|   Title    |          Role         |       Tools        |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Author     | Creates content       | MS Word or similar |
| Editor     | Refines content       | MS Word or similar |
| Designer   | Develops page designs | InDesign           |
| Typesetter | Executes page design  | InDesign           |

That works really well for print books. When you're making more than print books, these roles and tools might change. The exact changes will vary among teams and projects, but common ones might look like this:

|   Title   |                              Role                             |         Tools         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Author    | Creates content                                               | MS Word or similar    |
| Editor    | Refines content, creates computer-readable text and structure | Google Docs, markdown |
| Designer  | Develops stylesheet templates                                 | CSS                   |
| Developer | Maintains systems                                             | Code libraries        |

Importantly, the designer and developer might not work on every book. They create templates and systems that are simply repeated without intervention.

What does not change is that every team needs to develop it's own processes. No amount of technology removes the need to establish processes and team culture that make great books.

## Version control



### Real-time version control



### Turn-based version control

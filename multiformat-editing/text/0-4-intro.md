# Introduction

In this short course, we're aiming to give book editors an overview of what it means to edit multi-format publications.

What's a multi-format publication? Let's say it's a book that you might read on paper, on a website, as an ebook, or in an app. Maybe more! The fact is, when you edit books these days, you have no idea where or how people will read your work. So we're editing for that uncertainty, and learning new skills to do it.

1. You get raw manuscript from an author.
1. You transform it into a document with a structure that a machine can follow.
1. You might work with designers or developers to refine your document, with certain formats in mind. (Maybe a print book and an ebook.)
1. The book is printed and copies are sold and warehoused.
1. Your document enters the big, uncertain world of the Internet, and countless machines process it, over and over again, in countless different ways.
1. From time to time, you update it and put the new version on the Internet.
1. People order copies that are printed on demand at the warehouse.
1. If you've made it well, it has a long and happy life in places you never dreamed of.
1. There is no limit to how many people might read it.
1. It exists for as long as the Internet exists.

Compare this to the old way:

1. You get a raw manuscript from an author.
1. You clean it up and add instructions to a typesetter.
1. The typesetter lays out each page and sends you a PDF.
1. You and the typesetter refine the PDF until it's print-ready.
1. The book is printed and copies are sold and warehoused.
1. You make some reprint corrections.
1. The book goes out of print.
1. Some copies exist in library storage.

The new way is harder, scarier, and much better for the world. Books are now far more like websites than traditional paper books were: they are living documents that exist simultaneously on paper and in a digital ecosystem that is constantly evolving.

The Internet is much bigger than print publishing ever was. There is more work for editors than ever. And greater responsibility on us to put high-quality, socially responsible content into the world. It's time to learn some new tricks.

Let's get to work.

## What we'll cover

1. [**Context**](01-context.html)

    The first section sets out some big, important features of multi-format world that we need to know about.

2. [**Connecting humans and machines**](02-connecting-humans-and-machines.html)

    As production and distribution becomes automated, we need to learn how to talk to machines. Here we'll talk about preparing documents that computers can process.

3. [**Choosing tools**](03-tools.html)

    Each of us need to refresh our toolboxes. We can throw out some old tools (like MS Word), and try out new ones till we find what works for us. There's no Swiss Army knife for multi-format editing. So what should we learn and look for?

4. [**Collaboration**](04-collaboration.html)

    When we plug our work into the Internet, we get two big new tools: easier collaboration and proper version-control. We'll talk about how your editorial team might change, and about different approaches to version control.

5. [**Building blocks of books**](05-building-blocks.html)

    Books have long been made of well-established building blocks, like pages, chapters, frontmatter and endmatter. We'll quickly touch on the building blocks of multi-format books: what's the same, and what's changing?

6. [**Text**](06-text.html)

    You might want to skip straight here: a list of common multi-format challenges and tricks for dealing with them, including links, cross-references, capitalisation, indexing and mathematics.

7. [**Images**](07-images.html)

    In the past, we only had to get a 300dpi image to the setter. Things are a bit more complicated now. But fun! We'll cover a short list of image must-haves.

8. [**Interactive elements**](08-interactive-elements.html)

    'Interactivity' is publishing's favourite buzzword these days. We'll touch on some of the main ways that users might interact with books, and how those features might work in print and on screen.

9. [**Data as content**](09-data-as-content.html)

    Books often contain little databases, like glossaries, bibliographies, lists of abbreviations. Some books are big databases, like dictionaries and catalogues. We'll talk briefly about what this means for preparing and structuring manuscripts.

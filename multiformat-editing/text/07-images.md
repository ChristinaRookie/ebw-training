While as an editor you might not be creating images, you will probably be briefing authors and designers and checking the quality and appropriateness of images. Here are some guidelines on what to ask for and look for

## Bitmap and vector images

There are two kinds of image files: bitmap (or raster) images and vector images.

- **Bitmap images** are saved as a set of pixels: a *map* of *bits*, even. The image file stores colour values for every pixel, plus some information about the image. If you enlarge bitmap images a lot, they pixelate: that is, you can start to see the individual pixels. Bitmap images are great for photographs or illustrations that contain many colours and shades.

    Bitmap file formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF. The safest bet for multi-format publishing is JPEG.

- **Vector images** are saved as a set of coordinates; a set of instructions that say where to draw lines and where to fill areas with colour. Every time a computer opens a vector image, it actually redraws it following those instructions. You cna make a vector image as big as you like and it will remain crisp on screen, because the computer just keeps redrawing it relative to its new, bigger coordinates. Vector images are great for line art and logos with few shades and less detail than a photograph. When used for these kinds of images, their file sizes are far smaller than the same image as a bitmap.

    Vector file formats include SVG, AI (Adobe Illustrator), and EPS. PDF is mainly a vector format, too, but can include bitmap elements.

<h1 id="stylesheets">Stylesheets</h1>

<p>In your HTML documents, your job is to mark up text and images according to its function or purpose. Never its appearance. All the appearance work is done in a separate file called a stylesheet. In the stylesheet, for instance, you get to say what a heading marked <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> looks like: colour, size, font, spacing, and so on. This way, you can change and control the appearance of all the elements in your book in one place, keeping formatting consistent everywhere.</p>

<p>We create stylesheets in a language called CSS, for Cascading Style Sheets. (Don’t worry now about how they cascade: that’ll become clear later.) In Sigil, HTML documents are stored in the Text folder of your epub, and CSS documents in the Styles folder.</p>

<p>CSS looks different to HTML, because it’s a different language with its own syntax. Let’s say you want to control the appearance of your default paragraphs. In CSS, you’d start by typing:</p>

<p><code>p {}</code></p>

<p>The <code>p</code> refers to the HTML <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, obviously. All your formatting instructions will go inside the braces, <code>{}</code>. For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">p {
	font-size: 12pt;
	font-family: serif;
	}
</code></pre>

<p>I’ve put each instruction on its own, new, indented line to make it easier for us humans to read – the computer doesn’t mind. It’s the same as writing this:</p>

<p><code>p {font-size: 12pt; font-family: serif;}</code></p>

<p>But when CSS documents get long and complicated, you really want things laid out neatly so that you can edit them easily.</p>

<p>Now, what about our classes? Like the ‘greeting’ class we created in <code>&lt;p class="greeting"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;</code>? In CSS, we use a full-stop to indicate ‘in class’, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">p.greeting {
	color: pink;
	}
</code></pre>

<p>Once we’ve added that, our <code>Hello, World!</code> will show in pink in our ebook. (Note the American spelling of <code>color</code>. The same goes for instructions like <code>text-align: center;</code>.)</p>

<p>Open this ebook in Sigil and take a look at the CSS file to see a longer, but still very simple stylesheet. Note that you can add comments for humans that the computer will ignore by putting them between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.</p>

<h2 id="linking-html-and-css-files">Linking HTML and CSS files</h2>

<p>Once you’ve created a CSS file, you have to tell your HTML file where to find it. That is, you have to <em>link</em> your HTML to the CSS file.</p>

<p>We do this by adding a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML document. Let’s say your CSS file is called <code>styles.css</code>. In Sigil, your <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag will look like this:</p>

<p><code>&lt;link href="../Styles/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</code></p>

<p>This link element contains three attributes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>&lt;href=…&gt;</code> (<code>href</code> for ‘hyperlink reference’) says where the stylesheet is, relative to the HTML document (the two full-tops mean ‘go up out of the Text folder’, and the <code>/Styles/styles.css</code> means ‘go into the Styles folder and find the <code>styles.css</code> file);</li>
  <li><code>rel="stylesheet"</code> says that the file’s relationship to the HTML is that of a stylesheet;</li>
  <li><code>type="text/css"</code> says that the file will be in plain text and in the CSS language.</li>
</ol>

<dl>
  <dt>Note: self-closing tags</dt>
  <dd>The link element needs only one tag, because it doesn’t mark up, or surround, any text. So it <em>closes itself</em> with a ‘self-closing slash’ at the end of the tag. Two other common HTML elements that close themselves are the line break <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> and the image tag <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Here are several things you might want to do with CSS. Pick one, get onto Google, and take 5 minutes to have a guess how you’d write the CSS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make the background of your whole ebook yellow;</li>
  <li>put a paragraph in a box;</li>
  <li>make a paragraph float to one side, with the body text flowing around it;</li>
  <li>make one word appear in a different font to the surrounding text;</li>
  <li>make a heading appear in uppercase, without changing the letters to uppercase in your HTML;</li>
  <li>create a list inside a list (a sub-list);</li>
  <li>make a numbered list number in roman numerals.</li>
</ul>

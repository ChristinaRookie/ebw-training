<p>In this course we rarely get to talk through advanced tricks and serious bug fixing. Those are things you’re going to have to tackle when they arise. Things that’ll come up at some stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mathematical notation: this is a real headache. usually, the only solution is to include images for every instance of maths.</li>
  <li>Sub-headings: note that &lt;h2&gt; can’t be used as a sub-heading to &lt;h1&gt;. It’s a second-level of heading. Sub-headings usually have to be paragraphs with a special class, like class=”h1-subheading”.</li>
  <li>Transparency in images: gif and png images can have transparent areas, like the background. if you have black line art, do you make your backgrounds white or transparent? On sepia-background ereaders, white backgrounds look ugly. But on white-on-black ereader settings, black line art on a transparent background will be invisible.</li>
  <li>Embedding or linking to video: this is a real headache that you should <a href="http://electricbookworks.com/kb/epub-production-tips/embedding-video-and-audio/">read about online</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more challenges. Always search and ask online, because someone out there’s faced them all before.</p>

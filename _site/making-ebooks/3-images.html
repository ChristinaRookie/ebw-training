<h1 id="adding-images">Adding images</h1>

<p>You are going to want to add or edit images in ebooks often. Luckily, this is very simple.</p>

<p>First, add the image to the epub’s Images folder. In Sigil, just right-click the Images folder and select Add Existing Files. Then go find the image on your computer, and Sigil will copy it to that Images folder. Remember, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>remove all spaces from image file names;</li>
  <li>try to use only lowercase letters in file names (for one thing, Sigil alphabetises file names differently according to the case of the letters, bizarrely);</li>
  <li>only use jpg or gif images (png is usually also okay);</li>
  <li>before adding, make sure the images are 72 to 150 dpi, large but not larger than 1000px on their longest side, and saved as RGB, not CMYK.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, head back to your HTML document to add an image tag where the image must appear. Image tags must always include two attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>src for source, indicating the image file you just added, and</li>
  <li>alt for alternative text, which appears if the image breaks and is read out loud is reader for the visually impaired.</li>
</ul>

<p>An image tag can also include a title attribute, which provides more info about the image. Many ereaders show the title as a tooltip when a user mouses over the image.</p>

<p>Finally, the image tag must self-close with a slash.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>&lt;img src=”../Images/example.jpg” alt=”Example image” title=”An example of an image in an ebook” /&gt;</p>

<p>Which might show like this in the rendered ebook:</p>

<p><img src="../Images/lily_by-arthur-attwell_20130214_194014.jpg" alt="Example image" title="An example of an image in an ebook" /></p>

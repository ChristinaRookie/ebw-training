<h1 id="testing-and-validation">Testing and validation</h1>

<p>Ebooks should be thoroughly checked, sometimes even proofread, just like print books. There are two parts to checking ebooks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>validating the code, and</li>
  <li>checking the ebook on ereaders.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="validating-the-code">Validating the code</h2>

<p>Sigil includes a useful validation tool that checks the technical correctness (validity) of your epub file. (It’s called ‘FlightCrew’.) Go to <code>Tools &gt; Validate EPUB with FlightCrew</code> or hit the green tick button. If there are technical errors, Sigil will give you a list of them, and you can click on the items in the list to jump to the problem.</p>

<h2 id="checking-on-ereaders">Checking on ereaders</h2>

<p>Always, always test on a few different ereaders, and scroll through the whole book for a visual check. We recommend that you try to test on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a good reading app on a tablet and/or phone like iBooks, Google Play Books, Aldiko;</li>
  <li>a web-based reader like Google Play Books or Ibis Reader, or in Firefox using the EpubReader addon;</li>
  <li>Adobe Digital Editions on a computer (ADE has lots of problems, but it’s still the biggest computer-screen ereader next to Kindle);</li>
  <li>an e-ink reader (e.g. Sony, COOL-ER, BeBook, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>These tests should include a device with a small screen (less than, say, 5” diagonal; this can detect various formatting problems) and one with a large screen (above, say, 19”; this can detect low-res covers and missing page breaks).</p>

<p>A range of options like this will usually also include a device with an Adobe engine (i.e. one based on the Adobe Reader Mobile SDK, such as Sony Readers and B&amp;N Nook), and a device with a WebKit engine (e.g. Ibis Reader, iBooks).</p>

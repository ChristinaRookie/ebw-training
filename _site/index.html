<h1 id="ebw-training">EBW training</h1>

<h2 id="making-ebooks-with-sigil-html-and-cssmaking-ebooks0-3-contentshtml"><a href="making-ebooks/0-3-contents.html">Making ebooks with Sigil, HTML and CSS</a></h2>

<p><em>Making ebooks with Sigil, HTML and CSS</em> is an in-depth, practical crash course in ebook production, ideal for <em class="highlight">editorial and production staff familiar with InDesign.</em> The aim is to provide your organisation with in-house technical expertise for quality assurance and production-process decisions. We teach basic HTML and CSS (stylesheets) to enable participants to create, evaluate and fix basic epubs, and to know how to tackle problems when they arise. Participants work mostly in Sigil and a little InDesign, learning how best to edit content and control layout. </p>

<p>This is a four-morning course over two weeks, and costs R6400 ex VAT per person, with a minimum of five people. </p>

<h2 id="digital-decisions">Digital Decisions</h2>

<p><em>Digital Decisions</em> is a closely facilitated workshop for <em class="highlight">middle and senior managers.</em> We cover a range of nitty gritty issues, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technology decisions (file formats, data-asset-management systems, metadata, DRM), </li>
  <li>rights and royalty decisions (territory, calculating royalties), </li>
  <li>product decisions (backlist conversions vs frontlist plans, publishing vs software development), </li>
  <li>administrative decisions (identifiers, reporting and tracking sales and costs), </li>
  <li>workflow decisions (editorial and design processes, managing in-house learning and knowledge, expertise and functional authority, format-agnostic
workflows), and </li>
  <li>sales and marketing decisions (pricing models, partners and findability, sales and delivery processes).</li>
</ul>

<p>The workshop can be held over one or two days, depending how much time you can devote to these issues, and how much depth you need your team to get into. Over one day, the workshop is a useful introduction to the many issues your team has to consider when making decisions. Over two days, the workshop can serve as a strategy session, getting everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>The workshop costs R2800 ex VAT per person per day, with a minimum of six people. There’s a 15% discount if you host it at your offices.</p>

<p>If you opt for the two-day version, for R5000 ex VAT we include a second facilitator to keep notes of key discussions and decisions and write up a concise report for you of key decisions, issues for further investigation and action points from the workshop.</p>

<h2 id="developing-books-for-the-digital-age">Developing books for the digital age</h2>

<p><em>Developing books for the digital age</em> is a closely facilitated, one-day workshop for your in-house <em class="highlight">authors and commissioning editors</em> on planning and compiling books that will become both print and digital products. We guide participants through a range of key issues, encouraging them to develop their ideas for developing a next generation of an existing series. This lets us build on existing material, while re-thinking the way that that material might be recast for digital use. It also lets participants think about both frontlist plans and what could be done with backlist titles.</p>

<p>For teams new to digital concepts, our process includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overview of important digital concepts (source content vs print and screen output formats, chunking, spreads vs reflow, enhancements, online vs offline, markup and metadata), </li>
  <li>an introduction to designing and commissioning interactive components (video, quizzes, simple games), and </li>
  <li>discussion of nitty-gritty editorial issues (from hyphenation to pageless cross-references).</li>
</ul>

<p>The workshop costs R2800 ex VAT per person, with a minimum of six people. There’s a 15% discount if you host it at your offices.</p>

<h2 id="kick-off-for-sales-teams">Kick-off for sales teams</h2>

<p>Print-oriented <em class="highlight">sales and marketing teams</em> can struggle with digital products: hardware, software, competition and customer needs are different. Even when you’re training teams in-house already, an outside perspective helps teams appreciate the new, broader ecosystem they’re now part of. Our short kick-off workshops for sales teams aim to boost their confidence and identify deeper training needs. In a two-hour session, we cover two areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce key concepts and issues in digital textbook products that customers want or need to know about. These may include user experience, hardware options, websites vs apps, DRM, connectivity (WIFI, 3G), offline/online, local/cloud. If you need us to cover specific apps (yours or competitors’) let us know.</li>
  <li>Facilitate an open discussion about the team’s experience to date and their vision for selling digital products, with a view to understanding what further training and support they’ll need to sell digital products in future.</li>
</ul>

<p>We charge a flat fee of R5000 ex VAT for a kick-off workshop at your offices, and recommend groups of between four and ten people at a time.</p>

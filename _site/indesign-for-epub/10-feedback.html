<h1 id="your-feedback">Your feedback</h1>

<p>Training in a new, fast-changing field is hard, so we really need <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/GW3tfIkXVK">your honest feedback about this course</a>. You can give very brief answers, though the more you can tell us the the better. Youâ€™re welcome to answer anonymously.</p>

<p><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/GW3tfIkXVK" class="non-printing button">Give feedback online</a></p>

<ol>
  <li>Given your expectations before the course, did you learn what you wanted to learn?
    <ul>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Mostly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Um. A bit of both.</li>
      <li>Only a little of what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Not at all what I had in mind.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What was the best thing about the course?</li>
  <li>What about the course most needs to change?</li>
  <li>Do you have suggestions for how to fix that?</li>
  <li>We know these courses are expensive. For you, was the expense:
    <ul>
      <li>worth the investment,</li>
      <li>too early to tell, or</li>
      <li>not really worth it?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What did you think of the venue?</li>
  <li>Assuming you had a positive experience, do you have any comments we could use publicly?</li>
</ol>

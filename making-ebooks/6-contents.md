Tables of Contents
==================

Epubs store clickable tables of contents in a special file called toc.ncx. You can see it in Sigil, but you do not want to edit it directly. Rather use Sigil's easy TOC generator to create and edit tables of contents. Go to Tools \> Table Of Contents.

Note that Sigil generates the TOC by collating all heading elements, from \<h1\> to \<h6\>. You can edit this manually in the TOC editor, but try to keep edits to a minimum. Ideally your heading levels should be so well-constructed that editing isn't necessary.

Metadata
========

Epub ebooks must store some information about themselves for ereaders to use. At the very least, they must store:

*   an identifier (like an ISBN)
*   the publisher
*   a date of publication or creation.

To add metadata in Sigil, just go to Tools \> Metadata Editor.

The metadata is actually stored in a special epub file called content.opf. Sigil will let you edit that file directly (just double-click it on the left), but editing it this way is not a good idea. You do not want to break something.

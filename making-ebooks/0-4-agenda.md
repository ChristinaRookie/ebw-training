*	An introduction to opening and reading ebooks in ereaders
*	An overview of HTML
*	CSS
*	Images
*	Links (internal and external)
*	Metadata
*	Tables of Contents
*	Covers
*	Testing and validation
*	Advanced tricks and bug fixing
*	Mapping features of your existing print-based books to HTML elements

Not all of these things are covered in these notes, but you can always read more just by Googling.

Testing and validation
======================

Ebooks should be thoroughly checked, sometimes even proofread, just like print books.

Sigil includes a useful tool that checks the technical correctness of your epub file. It's called 'FlightCrew'. Just go to Tools \> Validate EPUB with FlightCrew. If there are technical errors, Sigil will give you a list, and you can click on the items in the list to jump to the problem.

1.	Given your expectations before the course, did you learn what you wanted to learn?
	*	Exactly what I wanted.
	*	Mostly what I wanted.
	*	Um. A bit of both.
	*	Only a little of what I wanted.
	*	Not at all what I had in mind.
2.	What was the best thing about the course?
3.	What about the course most needs to change?
4.	Do you have suggestions for how to fix that?
5.	We know these courses are expensive. For you, was the expense:
	*	worth the investment,
	*	too early to tell, or
	*	not really worth it?
6.	What did you think of the venue?
7.	Assuming you had a positive experience, do you have any comments we could use publicly?

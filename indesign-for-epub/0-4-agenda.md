# Course outline

These guidelines are for designing and typesetting with epub export and conversion in mind. They are also good design and typesetting practice even if you’re not sure you’re going to be exporting or converting to epub. We'll cover:

*	Frames: one story flow, pagination and master pages, images and objects
*	Fonts
*	

You'll find much of these, plus updates and comments, on the Electric Book Works Knowledge Base at [electricbookworks.com/kb](http://electricbookworks.com/kb).

If you really want to understand why and how to best use InDesign, you should also get to grips with epub code. For that, check out EBW's notes on [*Making ebooks with Sigil, HTML and CSS*](http://electricbookworks.github.io/ebw-training/making-ebooks/0-3-contents.html).

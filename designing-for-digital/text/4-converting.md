# Converting books to ebooks

## First-step: decisions

In an ideal world, turning books into ebooks would be as simple as
clicking “Save as...” in any good text-layout software. It will be one
day, but right now it’s not (not even in InDesign, though it gets better
with each version). This is partly because the industry is young, so the
tools haven’t been developed fully yet. But more than that, it’s because
you (and your clients or bosses) have to make some decisions about the
nature of the ebooks you’re creating. Each ebook can be a little
different.

Let’s go through some of those decisions.

Is design and layout (including typography, colours, and the exact
placement of images) important for understanding the content?

-   Yes: Just create a PDF ebook. You’ll lose the ability to sell it on
    Kindle and iBooks, but using any other format will be a real
    headache. PDF files are much easier to make in-house than EPUB or
    MOBI files.
-   No: Create an EPUB file. You’ll have more flexibility in the long
    run, and can distribute easily through more important stores (like
    Kindle) now.

Do you want DRM?

-   Yes: Are you sure? Okay. Building your own DM software is too
    expensive, and you don’t want your customers to have to install
    special software to open your books, because most won’t and those
    that do will hate you for it. So use the industry standard [Adobe
    Content Server](http://www.adobe.com/products/contentserver/) (ACS).
    You could install your own ACS for about \$5000 a year and a lot of
    technical heartache, but it’s easier to just use a distributor that
    includes Adobe DRM in their offering.
-   No: Super, your life will be much simpler, and your customers
    happier. If you positively want not to have DRM, you must make that
    clear to your distributors who mostly use DRM by default.

How big can the ebook file be, considering your market? (Think about
bandwidth and the devices they’ll use to read it.)

-   Small: If you need customers to read the ebook offline on mobile
    phones and older ereaders, you need to keep the ebook under, say,
    2MB. A novel in EPUB is often around 1MB, about half of which is the
    cover image. Keep it this small if your users are in low-bandwidth
    areas (most of Africa, especially outside major cities). The
    device-restrictions on size sometimes apply to specific components
    of the ebook, such as images or video inside the ebook.
-   Medium: If you have colour images in your book, you might get away
    with 3 to 10MB, which customers will download in several minutes,
    depending on their bandwidth and their location relative to the
    download server. Smartphones (not basic phones) might handle this.
    Some ereaders and all computers will.
-   Large: Anything over 10MB (lots of images or video and audio) may
    start to push customers’ patience or slow their software down. But
    if you’re offering a great product, they’ll wait for this. Anything
    over 20 to 25MB is only going to work on computers and very powerful
    smartphones.

How much linking and interactivity does your market expect, and how much
time can you spend on providing that?

-   Value: If your product is a reference book, it’s a good idea to
    spend time making sure links are clickable. And perhaps not just
    links but references to or pictures of things like famous people
    (e.g. to their websites or Wikipedia pages) or places (e.g. to a
    location on Google Maps). Assume you’ll spend about three minutes
    creating every link; a hundred links then takes about five hours.
-   Waste: Ebooks can suck a lot of your time and money for little
    return. Keep it simple. Some publishers produce ‘enhanced editions’
    of some their books, where words in the text link to related
    websites. These link are often just boring and distracting!

Must this ebook be read offline, or is it only online content?

-   Online: Here, users must be connected to the Internet to access the
    content. Making some or all of an ebook available only while online
    is a great way to restrict illegal copying and gather user data. But
    content that requires an internet connection (e.g. [Sesame
    Workshops’
    content](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735004574576223643509900.html)
    or any DRM that requires an internet connection every time you open
    the ebook) is not, in my opinion, an ebook: it’s a website behind a
    paywall, filled with book-like content. Which is fine, if your
    customers always have a good Internet connection.
-   Offline: Well, that’s what ebooks are, really: downloadable (i.e.
    save-me-to-read-offline-later) packages of book-like content.

Is accessibility for the visually impaired important?

-   Yes: If you’re making a PDF ebook, make sure it’s a ’tagged PDF’.
    That will help users with speech-emulating software to navigate the
    book. If you make a well-structured EPUB, that’s already pretty
    accessible, though DRM can muck it up.
-   No: Seriously? See ‘Yes’ above.

What systems or services will you use to distribute this ebook?
(Different ones can handle different kinds of files.) Some examples:

-   [Amazon Kindle](https://kdp.amazon.com/kdp/self-publishing/signin):
    By far the biggest ebook retailer around. You can upload a wide
    variety of formats (even MS Word) and Kindle will automatically
    convert them to Amazon’s PRC or MOBI formats. But check the
    conversions carefully, because automated conversions are often
    buggy.
-   [iBooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks#iBookstore): Apple’s
    ebook store for iPad and iPhone only sells EPUBs.
-   [Scribd](http://scribd.com/): Known as the “YouTube of books”, you
    can upload PDFs to Scribd for people to see for free. You can make
    parts of the book visible to the public (e.g. free excerpts), and
    embed a Scribd book viewer on your own website. Depending where
    you’re based, you can sometimes sell your ebook in PDF or EPUB
    format.
-   [Issuu](http://issuu.com/): Similar to Scribd, but aimed more at the
    magazine market. Only for free content (e.g. excerpts), you can’t
    sell here.
-   [Wattpad](http://wattpad.com/): Aimed at authors and self-publishers
    sharing their work for free. Fine for excerpts, for example. It’s
    main advantage is its usability on mobile phones, and large
    following among younger people. You can upload plain text, MS Word
    or EPUB files.
-   [Smashwords](http://smashwords.com/): Intended mainly for self and
    small-scale publishers, Smashwords has one main advantage: upload a
    Word file, and Smashwords automatically converts into several other
    formats, and gets your ebook listed on “Barnes & Noble, Sony, Apple
    iPad iBookstore, Kobo and the Diesel eBook Store, and to all major
    smartphone platforms via app providers such as Aldiko, Page Foundry,
    Kobo and Word-Player.” Note, not Kindle. This is perhaps the easiest
    and most comprehensive free distribution service available.
    Smashwords is entirely DRM-free.
-   [Lightning Source](http://lightningsource.com/): If you want a free
    way to sell through many retailers and restrict your books with DRM,
    Lightning Source is an excellent option. (Plus, if you want
    print-on-demand distribution, Lightning Source’s true claim to fame,
    you can manage that through the same interface.) Lightning Source is
    part of Ingram, a major international book and ebook distributor.
    Retailers working with Lightning Source (they pay a setup fee to
    carry the Lightning Source catalogue) automatically sell all the
    ebooks stored with Lightning Source on their own sites. Lightning
    Source provides industry-standard Adobe DRM to restrict copying and
    printing. (Very small publishers are directed to IngramSpark for
    similar services.)
-   [Overdrive](http://overdrive.com/): Similar to Lightning Source in
    operation, Overdrive is an aggregator that makes your ebooks
    available to a large number of retailers. Overdrive provides the
    same DRM restrictions as Lightning Source.
-   [E-Junkie](http://e-junkie.com/): E-Junkie is an example of a
    paid-downloads service. For a small monthly subscription, it’s an
    easy way to sell any digital (and therefore downloadable) file
    without having to set up your own website or downloads server, and
    keep the full retail-price revenue for yourself. You do need to use
    a major payment-processing service like PayPal or Google Checkout to
    receive your money.
-   [Paperight](http://www.paperight.com): Paperight takes your ebook
    files (PDF or epub) and sells them printed out on-demand in copy
    shops. The copy shops pay you each time they print a book out for a
    customer.
-   [Facebook](http://facebook.com): You can sell directly from a
    Facebook page using a service like
    [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/ecommerce-plugins/facebook-commerce-and-social-sharing) or
    [Shop Tab](http://www.shoptab.net/).
-   A data-asset-management-system (DAMS): Large companies pay for
    complex, powerful systems for managing their ebooks, and each one
    has different requirements. Most of these include automated output
    to various formats, and can even send those formats straight to
    distributors and retailers for you. Examples are
    [LibreDigital](http://www.libredigital.com/), [North Plains’
    Telescope Publishing
    Platform](http://www.northplains.com/products/tpp), and
    [codeMantra’s Collection
    Point](http://www.codemantra.com/Collection_Point.htm), or
    Publishing Technology’s
    [iPublishCentral](http://www.publishingtechnology.com/about/whatwedo/digital/ipubcentral/)
    and
    [pub2web](http://www.publishingtechnology.com/about/whatwedo/digital/pub2web/).
    DAMS like this range from, say, R30 000 a year to millions a year.
    They are difficult to research in advance. For details you need to
    have a conversation with a sales consultant that usually includes an
    excruciating process of trying to extract prices from someone who
    first wants to know how deep your pockets are. For big businesses,
    this process is a necessary evil.
-   Your own website and server: This gives you maximum control, but is
    the most expensive option to set up, since you’ll incur
    software-development and design costs. This is fine if you’re a big
    company and want full control. But you lose out on the good traffic,
    network effects and search-engine results that existing large
    platforms generate by their sheer size and popularity.

## Creating a PDF ebook

This is the simplest ebook to make. It is just a PDF, but with settings
applied that make it great for reading on screen. This is most easily
done in Adobe Acrobat Pro (you may be able to get by with lesser,
cheaper equivalents, like Foxit Phantom), and is more a case of knowing
what steps to follow and which settings to choose than having any
particular technical skills.

First, though, you want to do as much of the work in InDesign as
possible, before tweaking the ebook in Adobe Acrobat Pro. Most of these
things you should do as part of your design and typesetting process. In
InDesign, you’ll create or see to:

-   Bookmarks (mainly using the automatic Table of Contents feature)
-   Hyperlinks (to places on the web and for email addresses)
-   Format and font (if you’re not using the print-edition layout, you
    might use a squarish page format to better fit a screen, and a
    larger-than-normal font)
-   Symmetrical margins and centred page numbers (same margins left and
    right, since an ebook is usually read page by page, not in spreads;
    unequal margins make the text jump from side to side when scrolling;
    same for page numbers)
-   Colour (for headings, if you like, or put off-white frames behind
    your page features in your master pages to avoid a glaring white
    page)
-   Book metadata (add metadata in InDesign’s File Info dialogue box)
-   PDF export settings (see below).

Then, export to PDF, and refine the PDF ebook in Acrobat Pro:

-   Check the PDF bookmarks (the clickable Table of Contents)
-   Add the cover image (as the first page, and add it to the Table of
    Contents/Bookmarks)
-   Add metadata (in the PDF’s Properties add at least the document
    title and author)
-   Set the Initial View (“Bookmarks Panel and Page”, “Single page”,
    “Fit page”, “Show: Document Title”)

Finally, check the PDF on various apps and devices to make sure
everything is there and works. Check the hyperlinks open the right web
pages and email addresses, and that the bookmarks (what Acrobat calls
the clickable table of contents) go to the right pages. Check the
metadata, too. For instance, many people forget to change or add the PDF
ebook’s ISBN, which should be different from the print book’s ISBN.

## Converting to EPUB using Calibre

Much of the time as a publisher, you want to be able to create lots of
ebooks  quickly. They don’t need to be works of art, you just need to
get the things up for sale. They need to work and to look fine, not
spectacular. Importantly, you need to make them cheaply. You could
outsource this (e.g. to one of many companies in India that do this),
but you’d rather do it in-house.

[Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) is a great open-source
ebook-management application for converting ebooks from one format to
another. Since you can work from a variety of file formats, your editors
can do this, not just your designers. If you have a clean, final MS Word
file, creating a sellable basic EPUB file can take about 20 minutes,
including some testing.

In short, to create an ebook file (say, EPUB) in Calibre, you can start
with an MS Word document. In Calibre, add it to your Library. Choose the
output format (EPUB in this case), and press Convert. You can bulk
convert, too, converting lots of different books to ebooks at once.

The Calibre user manual includes a [thorough explanation of the
conversion
process](http://calibre-ebook.com/user_manual/conversion.html) and how
to tweak it for best results. When you glance through this, you’ll see
why you needed to learn about HTML and CSS earlier on.

Another open-source ebook program is
[Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/). Sigil is a bit more technical,
since it requires that you know a bit of HTML and are familiar with the
way EPUB files are structured. It’s a WYSIWYG EPUB editor (as opposed to
a converter): so you can design your EPUB with simple, click-and-drag
type tools. You have to start with an EPUB file, or HTML or plain text.
So you could start with Calibre or InDesign to create a basic EPUB, and
then refine it in Sigil.

## Creating EPUB from InDesign

This is probably the best way to produce an ebook. InDesign has been
able to export InDesign documents to EPUB since CS3, but only in CS6 has
it become fairly reliable. From CS3 and CS4, you have to do a lot of
work after export to finish the EPUB (much of this extra work is covered
in detail on the [Electric Book Works Knowledge
Base](http://electricbookworks.com/kb/creating-epub-from-indesign/)). In
CS5, a few hours work, too. In CS6, you may have to put in an hour or
two to polish up the EPUB before it’s ready for proofreading and sale.

Here, I’ll just provide an overview. For really detailed guidance, check
out Elizabeth Castro’s excellent book [EPUB: Straight to the
Point](http://www.elizabethcastro.com/epub/), or visit the [EBW
Knowledge Base](http://electricbookworks.com/kb).

### Working in InDesign

Before you start, look through the book you’re about to work on. You are
probably going to be changing or making decisions about:

-   how the book’s InDesign files are structured (for instance, you’ll
    break up long documents into shorter ones, preferably chapters, and
    gather them in a single InDesign Book)
-   the fonts you use and their colours
-   the spacing before and after paragraph styles
-   how text in frames is threaded
-   master pages
-   images that need anchoring.

I’ll cover these issues in more detail later.

If you’re definitely only using InDesign to create an EPUB ebook (not a
print book), you do NOT need:

-   running headers/footers and page numbers on master pages
-   to specify margins or page size.

These two things will be discarded in the export-to-EPUB process. But
why limit yourself to ebook only? You might as well set things up for a
possible print edition, too.

Once you’ve set up your InDesign document properly, you can export to
EPUB. Note that in InDesign CS3 and 4 you export to EPUB using “Export
to Digital Editions...” (Adobe used to refer to EPUB as “Digital
Editions”, conflating the EPUB file format with their own EPUB-reading
software Adobe Digital Editions.)

Note: I’m assuming for the most part here that you’re using InDesign CS4
or later. If you’re using CS3, the EPUB export is very buggy, and you’ll
need to do a lot more to the EPUB files after export in order to create
working EPUBs, let alone good-looking ones.

### After exporting to EPUB

After you’ve created a basic EPUB from InDesign, there’s more to do to
make a polished, sellable EPUB. Depending on the version of InDesign
you’re using and how you’ve created your files, you may need to:

-   extract the contents of the EPUB file
-   add a cover
-   add all fonts to the manifest
-   make images resizable
-   check the order of book parts
-   add page breaks, remove span-related spaces, fix non-breaking spaces
-   correct the titles of the chapters (especially capitalization)
-   check that the Table of Contents works
-   add metadata
-   edit CSS
-   embed video/audio files if necessary
-   optionally (especially CS3): replace head tags with structured HTML
    head tags
-   zip the contents of the EPUB up again (in the right order).

And you’ll definitely need to test the EPUB thoroughly during and after
this process. In the end, you must get a human being to at least glance
at every page: just because it’s digital doesn’t mean it’s quick and
easy!

To do all this you'll almost always have to work with the EPUB's code at
some stage.
